# Creating a lesson...

## The lesson canvas
![lesson canvas][the_canvas]
A canvas starts out like many canvases; empty. The user starts by creating rows on the canvas by clicking the 'create row' button. The rows on the canvas can be split in two with the 'split column' button/icon. A row that has two columns can be merged into a single column again by pressing the 'merge column' button/icon. After a user has created rows and columns, they can proceed to fill in the spaces with lesson content components. The user can press the 'preview' button to preview the whole lesson to see how it will look to nornal users (the students of the course).

## Outlining a lesson
![creating lesson outline][outlining_lessons]
The canvas is a grid type of structure, where the user or lesson author begins by designing the outline of the lesson. This is done by dragging the given course content components on the left to the canvas. Each component can be on its own row or share a row with other components. After the lesson author has created a complete outline of the lesson, they can go on to fill the missing pieces (i.e, upload the requirement images/videos/audio or reference them if they have already been uploaded), they can also write the text content of the lesson.
## How an outlined lesson might look like..
![an outlined lesson][outlined_lesson]
Example of a filled in lesson outline. The example lesson above would include a video at the top, and then an article that would sit side-by-side with an image. All the components have a button/icon you can click to remove them from the canvas. The article has a button you can click to edit it. The image and video components have buttons you can click to upload them
## Uploading media onto an outlined lesson..
![uploading media][uploading_videos]
When a user is ready to upload a video. They can click the upload button and a pop over button will appear with the option to either link to a youtube video or to another video that the user has already uploaded in the past. The last thing they can do is upload a new video.
## Creating text content for an outlined lesson..
![creating text content][creating_text_content]
The text content is entered showdown-style; the user types on the left and they see a preview on the right. Ctrl+s saves the article, the article autosaves every 3 minutes (or something like that) as long as there has been changes to the content in a to-be-specified amount of time.
