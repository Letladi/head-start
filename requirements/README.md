## Requirements
The files in this folder are meant to document the creation and thinking that
went into this project. They are [timestamped](https://github.com/letladi/touch-t) so that you can take a look at them in the order that they were created. The mockups were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/)

My hope is that this will help those who read open source code for educational purposes
to easily nagivate the whole project and see how it was put together.
